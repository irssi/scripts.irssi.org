Having more than one /x regexp modifier is deprecated at /home/travis/build/irssi/scripts.irssi.org/extlib/lib/perl5/Perl/Critic/Policy/ValuesAndExpressions/RequireInterpolationOfMetachars.pm line 110.
String delimiter used with "split" at line 36, column 15.  Express it as a regex instead.  (Severity: 2)
"die" used instead of "croak" at line 37, column 5.  See page 283 of PBP.  (Severity: 3)
